Papps
=======================

Papps is a paste bin. Its written in haskell and uses happstack and
highlighting-kate amongst other things. It is also plugable, although it barely
has any plugins write now. Plugins can be compiled in, or a new executable can be
created to include custom plugins. 

If you use papps and you write plugins for it, please share the wealth! :)
